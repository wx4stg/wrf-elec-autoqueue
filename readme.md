wrf-elec-autoqueue
---

Scripts I'm using to automatically queue up and run wrf-elec on TTU HPCC.

Requires:

- compiled build of wrf-elec in /lustre/work/<your username>/wrf4-elec
- compiled build of WPS in /lustre/work/<your username>/WPS
- run `git clone https://github.com/wx4stg/wrf-elec-autoqueue /lustre/work/$USER/SUB` to get these scripts
- run bash wrf-scheduler.sh to execute
